# **Apple Picker in Unity**

## Extra Hard Mode

The objective is to catch apples that are the same color as the player's top basket. Extra hard mode begins at 4000 points.

Baskets rotate colors.
> Red, Yellow, Green
> Baskets rotate every 10 seconds

Apples that hit a basket must be of the same color as that basket.
> The wrong color will destroy the top basket
> Missing an apple the same color as the top basket destroys the basket. 

## Start and Game Over Menus
The start and game over screens were made to look somewhat legitimate. The custom buttons are made from panel layers to get a "transparent" button, as is the border. The font was replaced with an ApplePicker-friendly font.

## Refactoring	
Different design patterns and system libraries were experimented with in order to get a better feel and understanding for C# and Unity. This is apparent from the partially refactored Apple.cs and ApplePicker.cs scripts. 

## Git
Git was used for version control a third of the way through development. Branching and merging were utilized.
